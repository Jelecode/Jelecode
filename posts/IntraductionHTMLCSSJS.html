            <h1>Intraduction to programming using HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h1>

            <p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript are primarily associated with the 
                development of web applications, but their use is not limited 
                to the development of only that type of applications.
                Thus, the mentioned tschnologies are also used for the development 
                of Windows Store Applications, applications for smart phones, various 
                frameworks for automation and testing, and even microcontroller control and 
                low-level programming.
            </p>

            <h2>HTML</h2>

            <p>HTML is HyperText Markup Language used to structure data.</p>
            <p>For example, let's take the following text :</p>
            <p><pre>
HTML is HyperText Markup Language
            </pre></p>

            <p>If we want this text to be the title of an document created 
                using the HTML language, we will surround the text with tags 
                that will give it the structure and meaning of a title :
            </p>

            <p><pre><xmp>
<h1>HTML is HyperText Markup Language</h1>
            </xmp></pre></p>

            <p>The text is now structured using tags at the beginning and end 
                of the text. It can also be said that the text is marked 
                because HTML, in addition to the structure, also marks the text.
            </p>
            <p>A document in which data is marked with HTML tags is called 
                an HTML document. The basis of the HTML language is made up of 
                different tags used to mark data. When it said that someone knows 
                the HTML lanuage, what is actually mean is that he knows the various 
                tags used to mark up the data in an HTML document.
            </p>

            <p>HTML document tags are used so that programs that render the document 
                content can determine the semantic meaning of the document content. 
                So a program that reads HTML code knows that a certain block of text 
                is actually a heading, and another block of text is a paragraph.
            </p>

            <h2>CSS</h2>

            <p>CSS defines the presentation, that is, the appearance of the 
                document that will be presented to the user.
            </p>

            <p>CSS governs the appearance and formatting of all elements 
                in an HTML document. Thus, CSS makes it possible to style 
                HTML elements and other documents by creating CSS descriptions.
            </p>

            <p>For example, if we take the h1 elements from an HTML document and 
                write something like this :
            </p>

            <p><pre><xmp>
h1 {
    color:blue; }
            </xmp></pre></p>

            <p>This means that the h1 heading will be blue when 
                displayed to the user.
            </p>

            <h2>JavaScript</h2>

            <p>JavaScript is a programming language used to create 
                application logic.
            </p>

            <p>When the data is structured and presented in one HTML document 
                Such a document is styled using CSS. Then the user can see 
                the formatted HTML page, within which the data is presented in an 
                understandable way. If it is necessary to provide the user with 
                certan interactivity, then we use the JavaScript language.
            </p>

            <p>Since HTML and CSS are descriptive, and not programming languages, 
                JavaScript is used for all the logic.
            </p>

            <p>JavaScript is a dinamic, interpreted, programming language, 
                best known for its use as a script language for web pages. 
                It is based on prototypes, supports object-oriented, imperative 
                and declarative programming
            </p>

            <h2>Writing HTML, CSS and JavaScript code</h2>

            <p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript programming code can be written in the most 
                common text editor, such as Notepad, so this work doesn't require any 
                special development environment.
