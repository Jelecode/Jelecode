            <h1>Setting up Java Development Kit (JDK)</h1>

            <p>Java Development Kit is a distribution that consist of an 
                executable enviroment(virtual machine), an appropriate set of 
                functionslities and various tools intended for the development 
                of Java programs.
            </p>

            <h2>Downloading the JDK</h2>

            <p>OpenJDK can be downloaded from the following address</p>

            <a href="https://jdk.java.net/17/" target="_blank">https://jdk.java.net/17/</a>

            <p>The page at this address has links to download the OpenJDK 
                variant that corresponds to the operating system oy your 
                computer.
            </p>

            <img src="../images/Java/SettingUpJDK/JDK-1.png">

            <p>Under the Builds section you can see links to download the 
                appropriate version of OpenJDK.
            </p>

            <p>After downloading, it is necessary to configure the Java enviroment.</p>

            <p>The firste step in configuring the Java enviroment on Windows 
                operating systems involves unpacking the downloaded archive. 
                It is recommended creating a folder with the name Java on the primary 
                partition on your hard disk and unpack the contents of the downloaded 
                archive inside it. That way you will get the following folder on 
                your computer C:\Java\jdk-17
            </p>

            <p>There are several folders on this path, at the moment the most 
                important is the bin filder.
            </p>

            <p>Inside the bin folder are all the tools necessary for starting 
                and developing Java programs, primarily the Java virtual machine 
                and the Java compiler.
            </p>

            <p>In order to make these tools easier to use, the path where 
                the following folders are located will necessary be placed 
                within certain system variables :
            </p>

            <p>- the path where the bin folder is located must be placed 
                inside the Path system variable
            </p>

            <p>- the path where the complete JDK is located must be placed 
                inside the JAVA_HOME system variable>
            </p>

            <h2>Adding the path inside the Path system variable</h2>

            <p>1. Open the Control panel -> Advanced System Settings.</p>

            <img src="../images/Java/SettingUpJDK/JDK-2.png">

            <p>2. At the bottom of the window click on option Enviroment Variables.</p>

            <img src="../images/Java/SettingUpJDK/JDK-3.png">

            <p>3. Find the Path variable and double-click it.</p>

            <img src="../images/Java/SettingUpJDK/JDK-4.png">

            <p>4. In the resulting window, add the path where the bin 
                folder is located. Confirm by clicking the OK button.
            </p>

            <h2>Adding the JAVA_HOME system variable</h2>

            <p>1. Inside the Enviroment Variables window, click on the New button</p>

            <img src="../images/Java/SettingUpJDK/JDK-5.png">

            <p>2. In the New System Variable window, it is necessary to enter 
                the name and value of the new system variable. The name should 
                be JAVA_HOME, and the value sould be the path where OpenJDK is located.
            </p>

            <p>3. Confirm by clicking the ok button.</p>

            <h2>Checking the availability of Java tools</h2>

            <p>In order to be sure that we have completed the previous steps 
                without error, it is enough to open the console/terminal and enter 
                the following command :
            </p>

            <p>java -version</p>

            <img src="../images/Java/SettingUpJDK/JDK-6.png">

            <p>Effect of the command will be the version of the Java enviroment 
                that exist on the system.
            </p>
