            <h1>If, else if, else</h1>

            <p>Controlling the flow of execution in Java can be achived 
                by branching (conditional execution) and looping (repetition).
            </p>

            <h3>Branching</h3>

            <p>Branching allows ceratin commands to be executed only if a condition is met. 
                This is why branching is closely related to logical data types and logical 
                operators. 
            </p>

            <p>Java makes it possible to create several possible branches of execution, and 
                the selection of the branch of execution itself depends on some control logic value.
            </p>

            <p>Java recognized two types of conditional statements : </p>

            <p>- if ... else; </p>

            <p>- switch.</p>

            <h2>If statement</h2>

            <p>The basic branching statement in Java is the <i>if</i> statement. 
            This command exists in practically all programming languages, and its 
            purpose is reflected in the name itself.
            </p>

            <p>The word <i>if</i>, by itself, does not make much sense in retoric, and 
            the same in programming. <br>In addition to this keyword, it is necessary to 
            set some condition on which the outcome of this command will depend. <br>So 
            the general syntax of the <i>if</i> statement looks like this :
            </p>

            <p><pre><xmp>
if (condition) {
    //code to execute if condition is met.
}

            </xmp></pre></p>

            <p>To form an <i>if</i> statement, the keyword <i>if </i> is used, followed by a 
            condition in brackets. If the condition is met, the code block of the 
            <i>if</i> statement is executed.
            </p>

            <p>An example that illustrates the use of the if statement :</p>

            <p><pre><xmp>
int age = 17;

if(age < 18) {
    System.out.println("Underage");
}
            </xmp></pre></p>

            <p>At the beginning, a variable with the name <i>age </i> an the value <i>17 </i> 
            is declared and initialized. After this line, the <i>if </i> command follows. 
            The condition is defined to check whether the value of the <i>age </i> variable is less 
            then 18. <br>If this condition is met, the block of code between curly brackets is 
            executed, which in the example has only one command.
            </p>

            <p>If the value of the variable <i>age </i> was greater than or equal to the 18, 
            the block of code from the example would not be executed.</p>

            <h3>Blocks of the conditional statements</h3>

            <p>In the example just shown, you could see that the <i>if </i> statements 
            consists of a condition and a block. <br>A block is formed like any other block 
            in the Java language, using curly brackets.
            </p>

            <p><pre><xmp>
if(age < 18) {
    System.out.println("Underage");
} 
            </xmp></pre></p>

            <p>However, it is important to know that the brackets for forming a block can 
                be omitted if the block has only one command :
            </p>

            <p><pre><xmp>
if(age < 18) 
    System.out.println("Underage");
            </xmp></pre></p>

            <p>It is important to remember that in this case an <i>if </i> conditional 
            block can have only one statement. Any command after that will not be part of the <i>if </i> 
            block.</p>

            <h2>if...else statement</h2>

            <p>If it is necessary to execute a specific block of code when the <i>if </i> 
            condition is not met, the keyword <i>else </i> is used, so <i>if </i>  becomes 
            <i>if...else </i>.</p>

            <p><i>if...else </i> is a flow control command that allows defining the logic that will 
            be executed if the condition is met, but also the logic that will be executed if the 
            condition is not met. <br>The syntax of the <i>if...else </i> state is as follows :</p>

            <p><pre><xmp>
if(condition) {
    statement_1;
} else {
    statement_2;
}
            </xmp></pre></p>

            <p>After the keyword <i>if </i>, the condition is specified in brackets. <br>If 
            this condition is met, the first statement is executed (statement_1), otherwise 
            the second statement is executed (statement_2).</p>

            <p>Depending on whether the condition is met, one of these two code blocks 
                is executed. It is important to understand that one block of code will need to be 
                executed. Which block it will be depends on the condition.
            </p>

            <p>An example of using <i>if...else </i> statement :</p>

            <p><pre><xmp>
if (age < 18) {
    System.out.println("Underage");
} else {
    System.out.println("Adult");
}
            </xmp></pre></p>

            <p>In the example, the condition <i>age&lt;18 </i> is defined, if the age is 
            less than 18, the code block that prints "Underage" will be executed, otherwise 
            the code block that prints "Adult" will be executed.</p>

            <p>An <i>if...else </i> statement can have only one <i>if </i> block 
            and only one <i>else </i> block. The condition is always defined only 
            on the <i>if </i> block.</p>

            <script async="async" data-cfasync="false" src="//pl20655413.highcpmrevenuegate.com/4de7177914e44ce15df5cdbc4cbc76b5/invoke.js"></script>
            <div id="container-4de7177914e44ce15df5cdbc4cbc76b5"></div>

            <h2>if...else if... else statement</h2>

            <p>In the previous lines, it was shown that the <i>if...else </i> statement 
            can have only one condition and that is on the <i>if </i> block. <br>If it is 
            necessary to define additional code blocks with their own conditions, 
            <i>if...else if...else </i> statement is used.</p>

            <p><i>else...if </i> enables additional conditions to be defined when creating an 
            <i>if...else </i> statement, so <i>if...else </i> statement becomes <i>if...else if...else </i> 
            statement.</p>

            <p>The syntax of such commands is as follows :</p>

            <p><pre><xmp>
if(condition_1) {
    statement_1;
} else if(condition_2) {
    statement_2;
} else if(condition_3) {
    statement_3;
} else {
    statement_4;
}
            </xmp></pre></p>

            <p>In this example, in addition to the <i>if </i> and <i>else </i> blocks, there 
            are also two <i>else if </i> blocks. <br>If the first condition is met (condition_1), 
            statement_1 will be executed. If the second condition is met (condition_2), statement_2 
            will be executed. If the condition_n is met, statement_n will be executed. </p>

            <p>It is important to understand that the number of <i>else if </i> blocks can be 
            arbitrary. </p>

            <p>If none of the conditions are met, the command in the <i>else </i> block is 
            executed.</p>

            <p>An example of using the <i>if...else if...else </i> command is as follows :</p>

            <p><pre><xmp>
int age = 32;

if(age < 18) {
    System.out.println("Underage");
} else if(age < 30) {
    System.out.println("18 - 30");
} else if(age < 40) {
    System.out.println("30 - 40");
} else if(age < 50) {
    System.out.println("40 - 50");
} else if(age < 60) {
    System.out.println("50 - 60");
} else {
    System.out.println("Older than 60");
}


Exit :
30 - 40

            </xmp></pre></p>

            <p>The first command declares and initializes the <i>age </i> variable with the 
            value 32.</p>

            <p><i>if...else if...else </i> command has 5 conditions. If the value of variable 
            <i>age </i> is less than 18, the first code block is executed. Since this is not the 
            case, the second condition (age&lt;30), is examined, since it is also not true, 
            the third condition (age&lt;40), is examined. <br>The third condition is met, 
            because 32 is less than 40, so the execution of the program enteres this <i>else if </i> 
            block and the message "30 - 40" is printed.</p>

            <p>It is important to point out another very important feature of the shown construction. 
                The fourth block has the condition age&lt;50 and the fifth block has the condition 
                age&lt;60. <br>If these conditions are analyzed, it can be concluded that they are 
                also met, because 32 is less then 50 and 32 is less then 60. <br>However, within 
                the statement <i>if...else if...else </i>, only one block of code is always executed, 
                and that is the first one whose condition turns out to be true.
            </p>

            <div id="container-4de7177914e44ce15df5cdbc4cbc76b5"></div>

            <h2>Ternary operator</h2>

            <p>By using the ternary operator, it is possible to assign a value to a 
                variable based on some condition :
            </p>

            <p><b>String message = (age&lt;18) ? "You are underage" : "You are adult";</b></p>

            <p>The condition is <i>age&lt;18 </i>, and the potential values that could be assigned to the 
            <i>message </i> variable are "You are underage" and "You are adult".</p>

            <p>If the condition is met, "You are underage" is assigned to the variable <i>message </i>, 
            otherwise "You are adult" is assigned to the variable.</p>

            <p>The ternary operator can always be transformed into an <i>if...else </i> statement. 
            <br>Thus, the shown logic can be transformed as follows : </p>

            <p><pre><xmp>
String message = "";
int age = 19;

if(age < 18) {
    message = "You are underage";
} else {
    message = "You are adult";
}

System.out.println(message);


Exit : 
You are adult

            </xmp></pre></p>


        </div>
