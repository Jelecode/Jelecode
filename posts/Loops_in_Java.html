            <h1>Loops</h1>

            <p>In the world of programming, loops allow a specific piece of code to be 
                executed multiple times by looping back the flow of execution.
            </p>

            <p>At the core of every loop is a process of repetition. Each repetition is 
                called <b>iteration</b>. <br>So loops are acttually made up of iterations. <br>The 
                loop starts with the first iteration and ends after the last iteration. The number 
                of iterations of a loop can be arbitraty, from zero to infinity. <br>A loop with 
                an infinite number of iterations has no end, so it is called a <b>dead loop</b>.
            </p>

            <h1>Loops in Java</h1>

            <p>Java has several commands that allow creations loops:</p>

            <p> - for</p>

            <p> - while</p>

            <p> - do...while</p>

            <p>Also, Java has two commands to control the execution of loops:</p>

            <p> - break</p>

            <p> - continue</p>

            <h2>For loop</h2>

            <p>A <b>for </b> loop allows a specific block of code to be executed an 
            exact number of times.</p>

            <p>Syntax of <b>for</b> loop:</p>

            <p><pre><xmp>
for (initialization; condition; final-expression)
    statement

            </xmp></pre></p>

            <p>A <b>for </b> loop is created using the <i>for</i> keyword. After this word, 
            there are three statements in brackets :</p>

            <p>- <b>initialization</b> - An intial statement that is executed only once, at the 
            beginning of the loop execution. It is used to initialize one or more loop counters.</p>

            <p>- <b>condition</b> - An command establishing the truth of a condition. If the condition 
            is met, the loop body is executed. This command is executed before each iteration.</p>

            <p>- <b>final-expression</b> - command to be executed after each iteration. It is mainly 
            used to increase or decrease the counter value.</p>

            <p>After the brackets containing the three statement just described, follows the body 
                of the loop inside the curly brackets. Inside the loop block can be any number of 
                statements that are repeated with each iteration.
            </p>

            <p>Example:</p>

            <p><pre><xmp>
for(int i=0; i<3; i++) {
    System.out.println("Hello");
}

Exit:

Hello
Hello
Hello

            </xmp></pre></p>

            <p>- the variable representing the counter exists only inside the <b>for</b> loop 
            and cannot be accessed outside the loop.</p>

            <h2>A loop within a loop</h2>

            <p>One <b>for</b> loop can be placed inside another <b>for</b> loop and thus 
            get an interesting structure. Such an approach is very often used in more 
            complex programs.</p>

            <p><pre><xmp>
for(int i=0; i<3; i++) {
    for(int j=0; j<5; j++) {
        System.out.println(j);
    }
}

            </xmp></pre></p>

            <p>It is easiest to observe this structure form the inside, that is, starting from the inner 
                loop. It has counter named <b>j</b> and inside the body of the loop the value of the counter 
                is printed. This inner loop will be executed five times, which means that the output will be 
                the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. <br>If there were no external <b>for</b> loop, that would be the only 
                output we would get from this program. <br>However, the outer loop causes the execution 
                of the inner loop to be repeated 3 times, resulting the following output:
            </p>

            <p><pre>
0
1
2
3
4
0
1
2
3
4
0
1
2
3
4

            </pre></p>

            <p>It is important to note that each loop has a counter with a unique name. Since 
                the inner loop belongs to the outer loop block, it is necessary to use a variable 
                with a unique name for the counter.
            </p>

            <h2>While loop</h2>

            <p>A <b>while</b> loop executes a specific block of code as long as the loop's 
            execution condition is met. This practically means that this type of loop does 
            not have a predefined number of iterations.</p>

            <p>The syntax of the <b>while</b> loop is as follows:</p>

            <p><pre><xmp>
while(condition) {
    statement
}

            </xmp></pre></p>

            <p>- As long as the condition is met, the block of code, i.e. the body of the loop, 
                is executed.
            </p>

            <p>Example:</p>

            <p><pre><xmp>
int x = 0;

while (x < 3) {
    System.out.println("Hello");
    x++;
}

            </xmp></pre></p>

            <p>At the beginning, the variable <b>x</b> is declared and initialized, with the value 0. 
            The <b>while</b> loop is created by using the <b>while</b> keyword, and after it, the 
            condition <b>x &lt; 3</b> is defined inside the brackets. <br>This practically 
            means that the loop will be executed as long as <b>x</b> is less than 3. <br>The body 
            of the loop is defines by curly brackets. Inside the body of the loop, the message 
            <b>Hello</b> is printed, but also the variable <b>x</b> is increased by one. <br>If 
            this increment were not specified, an infinite loop would be created, i.e. a loop 
            that would not stop executing.</p>

            <p>At the exit we get:</p>

            <p><pre>
Hello
Hello
Hello

            </pre></p>

            <h2>do...while loop</h2>

            <p>The <b>while</b> loop just described in no way guarantees that its body will be executed 
            at all. Simply, if the condition is not met, the body of this loop will not be executed.</p>

            <p><pre><xmp>
int x = 5;

while (x < 3) {
    System.out.println("Hello");
    x++;
}

            </xmp></pre></p>

            <p>If it is necessary to execute the loop at least once, regardless of whether 
                the condition is met, the <b>do...while</b> loop is used.
            </p>

            <p>The syntax of the <b>do...while</b> loop is:</p>

            <p><pre><xmp>
do {
    //statement
} while (condition);

            </xmp></pre></p>

            <p>The <b>do</b> keyword is placed at the beginning, followed by a block of code, 
            which is the body of the loop. After the code block, the while keyword is used to 
            define the condition of the loop's execution.</p>

            <p>Now the previous example can be transformed as follows:</p>

            <p><pre><xmp>
int x = 5;

do {
    System.out.println("Hello");
    x++;
} while (x < 3);

Exit:

Hello

            </xmp></pre></p>

            <p>The conclusion is that the body of the loop was executed once, regardless 
                of the fact that the condition was not met. <br>The condition check is placed after 
                the execution of each iteration.
            </p>

            <h2>Break and continue commands</h2>

            <p>Sometimes it is necessary to contol the execution of a loop based on some 
                condition within the body of the loop. <br>In such situations, it is possible to use 
                the <b>break</b> and <b>continue</b> commands.
            </p>

            <p>The <b>continue</b> command terminates the current iteration and moves on to 
            the next one. <br>The <b>break</b> command exits the loop.</p>

            <p>Example of using the continue command:</p>

            <p><pre><xmp>
int i;

for(i=0; i < 100; i++) {
    if(i > 50) {
        continue;
    }
    System.out.println(i);
}

System.out.println(i);

            </xmp></pre></p>

            <p>In the example, a <b>for</b> loop was created that will have 100 iterations. <br>However, 
            within the <b>for</b> loop, a condition is defined that checks if the counter is 
            greated than 50, if so, the <b>continue</b> command is called. <br>So the exit is:</p>

            <p><b>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 
                30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50
            </b></p>

            <p><b>100</b></p>

            <p>At the end, 100 is printed, which means that the loop was executed all 100 times, 
                althout not all numbers from 0 to 100 were printed due to <b>continue</b> command.
            </p>

            <p>Unlike the <b>continue</b> command, the <b>break</b> command exit from the loop.</p>

            <p>Example:</p>

            <p><pre><xmp>
int i;

for(i=0; i < 100; i++) {
    if(i > 50) {
        break;
    }
    System.out.println(i);
}
                
System.out.println(i);

            </xmp></pre></p>

            <p>Now the output will be:</p>

            <p><b>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 
                30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50
            </b></p>

            <p><b>51</b></p>

            <p>Now the execution of the loop is finished when the variable reaches a value greater 
                than 50, because the <b>break</b> command is defined by the condition.
            </p>

            <p><pre>
