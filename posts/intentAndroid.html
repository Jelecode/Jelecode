            <h1>Intent class</h1>

            <p>The Intent class is used to create objects for messaging between multiple 
                activities of a single application or multiple different applications. 
                In the other words, objects of this class are used to exchange messages, 
                that is, requests between application components of one or more applications.
            </p>

            <h4>Three basic uses of the Intent class:</h4>

            <h5>- Starting an activity</h5>

            <p>In applications with multiple activities, a program code must be defined to 
                open a new activity. This is exactly what the Intent class is used for. The 
                Intent class describes the activity that needs to be started and passes all the 
                necessary data to the newly created activity.
            </p>

            <h5>- Starting the service</h5>

            <p>In addition to starting an activity, Intent is also used to start a service. 
                A service is a special application component that performs operations in the background 
                and does not contain a graphical user interface. The Intent describes the service 
                that is started and passes all the necessary data to the service that is opened.
            </p>

            <h5>- Broadcast messages</h5>

            <p>Finally, by using the Intent class, it is possible to broadcast messages 
                to a wide range of receivers. Broadcast is actually a special type of message, 
                which can be received by any application installed on the system. The Android 
                operating system itself is a very frequent emitter of this type of messages. 
                By using the Intent class, it is possible to broadcast messages intended for 
                all applications on the system from an application that we develop independently.
            </p>

            <h2>How Intent works</h2>

            <p>The Intent class is used to express the intent of a component. Such component 
                forms its intent with the Intent class and passes it to the Android operating 
                system. Android operating system then determines, based on the passed Intent object, 
                what it needs to do.
            </p>

            <h2>Creating an Intent</h2>

            <p>Creating an Intent object requires a simple instantiation of this class, where it is 
                necessary to pass at least two parameters to the constructor: the sender and the recipient. 
            </p>
            
            <p>The following line of code illustrates the creation of an intent:</p>

            <p><pre><xmp>
Intent intent = new Intent(this, Target.class);
            </xmp></pre></p>

            <p>The first parameter passed to the constructor of the Intent class tells the 
                Android operating system who is the sender of the intent. The example uses the 
                "this" keyword to pass the current object of the class containing this line of code.
            </p>

            <p>The second parameter defines the name of the component that should accept 
                the Intent object. In the example, the name of the "Target" class is specified, using 
                the Target.class construction.
            </p>







            <h2>Passing parameters using the Intent object</h2>

            <p>One of the main uses of the Intent class is the ability to pass data along with 
                object of this class. It is very easy to pass data from one activity to another or 
                even from one application to another.
            </p>

            <p>In order to pass some additional informations to the recipient using the Intent 
                object, it is possible to use the putExtra() method. This is a method that has a 
                numbers of signatures, but they all work in an identical way, using key-value pairs. 
                Thus, putExtra method accepts two parameters, the first is a key and the second is 
                a value.
            </p>

            <p><pre><xmp>
intent.putExtra("message", value);
            </xmp></pre></p>

            <p>The first parameter of the String type, with the value "message", is the name, 
                that is, the key for the value that is passed. The second parameter is the name 
                of the variable that represents the value.
            </p>

            <p>The putExtra method has several different variants, depending on the type of 
                value being passed. Thus, a variable with the name value from the example can be of 
                different types: boolean, int, String, Object, etc.
            </p>

            <p>The putExtra method can be used multiple times to add multiple 
                key-value pairs:
            </p>

            <p><pre><xmp>
intent.putExtra("message1", value1);
intent.putExtra("message2", value2);
            </xmp></pre></p>

            <h2>Reading data</h2>

            <p>The process of reading data passed using the putExtra method requires several steps. 
                The first thing to do inside the destination component, in order to access the passed 
                data, is to call the getIntent() method.
            </p>

            <p>This is a method that returns an instance of the original Intent object. 
                Given that such an object contains forwarded data, the next step is to read such data.
            </p>

            <p>The procedure for reading specific data depends on its type. Thus, the following 
                example illustrates the process of reading String type data:
            </p>

            <p><pre><xmp>
Intent intent = getIntent();
String string = intent.getStringExtra("message");
            </xmp></pre></p>

            <p>In the example, you can see the use of the getStringExtra() method. 
                It is the method used to read data of type String. In addition to this method, 
                various other methods can be used, depending on the type of passed data: 
                getIntExtra(), getFloatExtra(), getDoubleExtra(), getCharExtra(), getByteExtra(), 
                getBooleanExtra(), ...
            </p>

            <h2>Types of Intent</h2>

            <p>There are two different types of intents that can be expressed using the 
                Intent class:
            </p>

            <h5>- Explicit intent </h5>

            <p>Defines the component to be run by specifying its full name. Therefore, this type of Intent 
                is most often used within an application, when the name of the component that 
                needs to be started is known in advance.
            </p>

            <h5>- Implicit intent</h5>

            <p>It is characterized by the fact that it does not specify the name of the component 
                that needs to be started, but defines a generalized action that needs to be implemented. 
                This type of Intent will be used, for example, in a situation where it is necessary 
                to display the user's location on a map. Given that such work will be performed by 
                the components of another application, the implicit Intent only expresses the intention 
                to perform a certain action, without explicitly specifying the component that will 
                perform it.
            </p>

            <p>An implicit intent defines an action that can be performed ba any application 
                on the system taht is capable of such a thing. Thus, using an implicit Intent is very useful 
                when the application itself cannot perform the required action, but some other 
                application on the system can.
            </p>

            <p>For example, if you need to create functionality that allows you to send a message 
                to some other devices, implicit intent is the ideal choice, because the system itself 
                will choose the application that will perform the process of sending the message
            </p>

            <p>In case there are multiple apps on the system that can do such a job, Android allows the 
                app users to select the app they want to use to perform a specific action.
            </p>
