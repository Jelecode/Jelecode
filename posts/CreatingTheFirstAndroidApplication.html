            <h1>Creating the first Android Application</h1>

            <p>To create an Android App we need the Android Studio 
                development environment. If you don't have the Android 
                Studio installed, install it according to the instructions 
                in the next page :
            </p>

            <a href="InstallingAndroidStudio.html" target="_blank">Download and install the Android Studio development environment</a>

            <p>The first step is to create a new project within Android 
                Studio development environment.
            </p>

            <img src="../images/Android/CreatingTheFirstAndroidApplication/CreatingTheFirstAndroidApp_1.png">

            <p>After selecting the option that we want to create a new 
                project, we get the following display for selecting an activity.
            </p>

            <img src="../images/Android/CreatingTheFirstAndroidApplication/CreatingTheFirstAndroidApp_2.png">

            <p> Activity is a special Java class that every Android Application must have. 
                This activity manages user interaction and is responsible for creating 
                a window within which UI controls can be placed. In other words, activity defines 
                things that the user can do. When creating a new project, Android Studio 
                allows the selection of a large number of different templates of the Activity 
                class, in order to enable developers to develop applications of a certain 
                type as quickly as possible. We're going to create an App from scratch so we 
                choose Empty Activity.
            </p>

            <p>By clicking on the Next button, a window is displayed in which we need 
                to configure the new project.
            </p>

            <img src="../images/Android/CreatingTheFirstAndroidApplication/CreatingTheFirstAndroidApp_3.png">

            <p>The name of the application is defined by the Name field.</p>

            <p>Package name is the name of the package. A package represents a 
                collection of Java classes and every Android Application must have 
                at least one package. The package name consists of the application name 
                and the company domain name. We can set any text for the name of 
                the company domain, which will be part of the package name, so in the 
                example of the image, the domain com.jelenko is used.
            </p>

            <p>The next field is Save location and defines the path where the 
                project files will be placed, that is, our Android Application files.
            </p>

            <p>In the language field, it is necessary to select the programming 
                language that will be used for the development of the application. 
                Kotlin and Java are available, and Java is selected.
            </p>

            <p>The next thing to select is the Minimum SDK. It represents the 
                minimum supported version of the Software Development Kit (SDK). 
                An SDK is a collection of packages with functionalities used 
                when developing an application. By choosing a lower API version, we 
                enable the application to work on older devices and increase the number 
                of devices on which application can work.
            </p>

            <p>Finally, clicking the Finish button establishes a new project 
                within the development environment.
            </p>

            <img src="../images/Android/CreatingTheFirstAndroidApplication/CreatingTheFirstAndroidApp_4.png">

            <p>The previous steps for setting up the Android project 
                produced the code for a fully functional Android Application.
            </p>

            <h2>Running the first Android App</h2>

            <p>In order to run the Android Application from the development 
                environment, it is enough to click on the Run App button, or 
                press the SHIFT + F10 keys on the keyboard.
            </p>

            <img src="../images/Android/CreatingTheFirstAndroidApplication/CreatingTheFirstAndroidApp_5.png">

            <p>The Application can be run on a virtual or real physical device. 
                Next to Run button for running the Application, the virtual device 
                on which the Application will be launched is displayed.
            </p>

            <img src="../images/Android/CreatingTheFirstAndroidApplication/CreatingTheFirstAndroidApp_6.png">

            <p>If we click on that drop-down menu, and click on Device Manager, 
                the Device Manager will open. We are going to create a new virtual device.
            </p>

            <img src="../images/Android/CreatingTheFirstAndroidApplication/CreatingTheFirstAndroidApp_7.png">

            <p>Clicking on the Create Device button opens a window for 
                configuring a new virtual device.
            </p>

            <img src="../images/Android/CreatingTheFirstAndroidApplication/CreatingTheFirstAndroidApp_8.png">

            <p>Android Studio allows the creation of virtual devices of different types.</p>

            <p>We have selected the Phone Category and the Pixel device.</p>

            <img src="../images/Android/CreatingTheFirstAndroidApplication/CreatingTheFirstAndroidApp_9.png">

            <p>The next device configuration page provides options related to the operating 
                system of that device.
            </p>

            <p>At this point, we need to check download next to the R name so 
                that we can use the latest version of the operating system. 
                After downloading, there will no longer be a download option 
                next to the R name. Then select R and click on Next button.
            </p>

            <img src="../images/Android/CreatingTheFirstAndroidApplication/CreatingTheFirstAndroidApp_10.png">

            <p>In this window, we need to set the name of the device, 
                the orientation of the screen and by clicking the Finish 
                button we create our virtual device.
            </p>

            <img src="..//images/Android/CreatingTheFirstAndroidApplication/CreatingTheFirstAndroidApp_11.png">

            <p>Now that we have a virtual device, to run the Application 
                it is enough to select the device and by clicking the Run button the 
                Application will be launched.
            </p>

            <img src="../images/Android/CreatingTheFirstAndroidApplication/CreatingTheFirstAndroidApp_12.png">

            <p>After starting the virtual device, our first Application will run on it.</p>

            <img src="../images/Android/CreatingTheFirstAndroidApplication/CreatingTheFirstAndroidApp_13.png">

            <p>The only functionality of this Application is to display
                 a welcome message "Hello World".
            </p>
