        <p>InteliJ IDEA is a development environment created by the Czech 
            company JetBraint in 2001. Based on the example of this development 
            environment, many other development environments were 
            created. One of them is Google's Android Studio development 
            enviroment.
        </p>

        <p>InteliJ IDEA ia a development enviroment primarily intended for the 
            development of programs using the Java programming language, but 
            also other languages that use the Java virtual machine for their 
            execution (Groovy, Kotlin, Scala, ...).
